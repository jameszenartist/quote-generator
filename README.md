# Quote Generator App Project

### Welcome to my Quote Generator Project created with Javascript!

<br>
I decided it was about time to strengthen my programming skills by diving deeper into asynchronous Javascript while using APIs, and what better way than to build my first quote generator!

The source of the code can also be found on my portfolio website:

[syntaxsamurai.com](https://syntaxsamurai.com/)

While currently the app is in a basic functioning state, I can assure you that updates such as UI/UX design, JS functionality, will be implemented in iterations as soon as I can! I also fully intend on using this as an opportunity to learn about and incorporate the use of new tools and features.
